# About Minicli

[Minicli](https://github.com/minicli/minicli) is an experimental small-footprint toolkit created by [erikaheidi](https://twitter.com/erikaheidi) for building CLI-only applications in PHP.


Minicli was created as [an educational experiment](https://dev.to/erikaheidi/bootstrapping-a-cli-php-application-in-vanilla-php-4ee) and a way to go dependency-free when building simple command-line applications in PHP. It can be used for microservices, personal dev tools, bots and little fun things.
